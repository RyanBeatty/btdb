Implementing join types
* build rangetable which consists of tabledef of every table + every intermediate table
* All verification code should take the range table the expression belongs to as an argument.
* Another issue is that right now AnalyzeJoinStatement sort of flattens out everything into a list of table defs.
Most of the code makes the assumption that when we join, it is in Inner join. The planner also plans using this flattened join list structure,
but this is incorrect since the join list will eventually have intermediate entries. What I really want is a tree. Leaf nodes in the trees are
rangetableentries containing a reference to the table def in the range table list that need to be scanned. Inner nodes are join nodes containing
join method, a reference to the intermediate table def in the range table list, and left and right children. When planning, traverse the tree.
RangeTableEntries map to Sequential Scans. Inner join nodes map to nested loops (taking into account join method and the qual condition).


* Convert fromclause into a list by doing a preorder traversal. For each node in the from clause,
  build the corresponding range table entries and remember indexes.
* When planning, iterate backwards over the join tree list and plan each node. (maybe building the jointree list
  is stupid, and I should just recursively process the join tree when planning?)
