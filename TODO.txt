Implementing join types
* build rangetable which consists of tabledef of every table + every intermediate table
* All verification code should take the range table the expression belongs to as an argument.
* Another issue is that right now AnalyzeJoinStatement sort of flattens out everything into a list of table defs.
Most of the code makes the assumption that when we join, it is in Inner join. The planner also plans using this flattened join list structure,
but this is incorrect since the join list will eventually have intermediate entries. What I really want is a tree. Leaf nodes in the trees are
rangetableentries containing a reference to the table def in the range table list that need to be scanned. Inner nodes are join nodes containing
join method, a reference to the intermediate table def in the range table list, and left and right children. When planning, traverse the tree.
RangeTableEntries map to Sequential Scans. Inner join nodes map to nested loops (taking into account join method and the qual condition).


* Convert fromclause into a list by doing a preorder traversal. For each node in the from clause,
  build the corresponding range table entries and remember indexes.
* When planning, iterate backwards over the join tree list and plan each node. (maybe building the jointree list
  is stupid, and I should just recursively process the join tree when planning?)
* 


Implementing Datum as uintptr_t
* First step is probably changing NULL from being a datum type to being a flag passed into every expression function.
Example: GetCol() should take a isNull out parameter. Expression code can just use the out parameter instead of having a whole
separate type for null.
* Next would be annotating binexpr nodes with the type of the expression.
* Can convert the data field of Datum to uintptr_t.
* Remove type field from Datum and convert from struct to typedef of uintptr_t. Type info should come from tupledesc or binexpr node.

* Keep a heap tuple as a single contiguous block. When returning from page, just return pointer. When modifying, copy everything over to newly alloced
  space. memcpy back to a place in page.

Alignment Issues?
* Need to investigate if I have any alignment problems (most likely yes) in the tuple representation code
* Maybe turn on -Wcast-align

Page Representation
* Page will be pointer to the buffer. PageHeader will have ItemLoc list
* After making functions for manipulating pages, need to switch tuples to be stored in pages. Unclear if having
  Scanner abstraction implemented makes this easier or not

Scanner abstraction
* Probably want to encapsulate the interaction between the buffer/disk with the plan execution code
* scanner should keep track of current page/tuple read. Be able to scan forward or inplace.
* Unclear if scanner should also have functions to insert/update/delete tuples
